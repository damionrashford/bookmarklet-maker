[![Bookmarklet Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ready-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/)

This bookmarklet provides a quick and easy way to jump directly to the Observe investigation page for a given Request ID found on *any* webpage.  It's particularly useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues within the Shopify ecosystem.

## Usage

Using the bookmarklet is simple:

1.  **Navigate** to a webpage that you suspect contains a Request ID. This could be an error page, a page with debugging information, or any page where a Request ID might be displayed.
2.  **Click** the "Request ID Observe" bookmarklet in your browser's bookmarks bar (or wherever you've saved it).
3.  **Instantly Investigate:** If a Request ID is found, the corresponding Observe investigation page will open in a new tab, allowing you to quickly dive into the details. If no Request ID is found, you'll see a brief alert message.

## How it Works

The bookmarklet intelligently scans the current webpage for a Request ID, checking the following locations in order:

1.  **DOM Elements:** It searches for any elements with class names or IDs that contain the strings "request-id" or "error-details". This is a common pattern for displaying Request IDs.
2.  **Meta Tags:** It checks for `<meta>` tags with the `name` attribute set to "request-id" or "RequestId". This is another standard way to include Request IDs, especially in server-rendered pages.
3.  **Page Content:** As a fallback, it searches the entire text content of the page for a string matching the Request ID pattern.

Once a Request ID is found, the bookmarklet constructs the appropriate Observe URL and opens it in a new tab.

## Installation

To install the bookmarklet, follow these steps:

1.  **Copy the Minified Code:** Copy the *entire* minified code block below. This is the complete, ready-to-use bookmarklet.

    javascript:(function(){var e,t=document.querySelectorAll('[class*="request-id"],[id*="request-id"],[class*="error-details"],[id*="error-details"]');Array.from(t).some(function(t){var o=t.textContent.match(/Request[\\s-]*ID:?[\\s:]*([a-f0-9-]+)/i);return o&&(e=o[1]),!!o})||(t=document.querySelector('meta[name="request-id"],meta[name="RequestId"]'))&&(e=t.getAttribute("content"))||(t=document.body.innerText.match(/Request[\\s-]*ID:?[\\s:]*([a-f0-9-]+)/i))&&(e=t[1]),e?window.open("https://observe.shopify.io/a/observe/investigate/requests?any_id="+e,"_blank"):alert("No Request ID found")})();

2.  **Create a New Bookmark:** In your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), create a new bookmark.  The exact steps vary slightly between browsers, but generally involve right-clicking on the bookmarks bar or going to the bookmarks menu.

3.  **Paste the Code:** In the "URL" or "Location" field of the new bookmark, paste the minified code you copied in step 1.

4.  **Name the Bookmark:** Give your bookmark a descriptive name, such as "Request ID Observe".

5.  **Save:** Save the bookmark. You can now click this bookmark whenever you're on a page and want to quickly find and investigate a Request ID.

## Building from Source (For Developers)

This `README.md` file is located in the `dist` directory, which is generated by the build process. You generally don't need to rebuild the bookmarklet unless you're modifying the source code.  If you *do* want to rebuild:

1.  **Navigate** to the package directory using your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/damionrashford/bookmarklet-maker/bookmarklet-factory/packages/efficiency-bookmarklets/packages/request-id-observe
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies** (only needed the first time, or if dependencies change):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Build Script:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

This command will regenerate the `dist/index.min.js` (minified) and `dist/index.js` (unminified) files.  The minified version (`dist/index.min.js`) is the one you should use for your bookmarklet.

[![Bookmarklet Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ready-brightgreen.svg)](https://shields.io/)

This bookmarklet provides one-click access to the Flow run logs page for the *current* Flow activity you're viewing in the Shopify admin.  It eliminates the need to manually navigate through the support tools.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate** to a Flow activity page within the Shopify admin.  This is the page where you see the details of a specific Flow run.
2.  **Click** the "Flow Run Logs" bookmarklet in your browser's bookmarks bar (or wherever you've saved it).
3.  **Instant Access:** The corresponding Flow run logs page on `flow.shopifycloud.com` will open in a new tab, giving you immediate access to the detailed logs.

## How it Works

The bookmarklet works by:

1.  **Extracting the Run ID:** It intelligently extracts the unique `run_id` from the current page's URL.  This ID is specific to each Flow run.
2.  **Constructing the Logs URL:** It uses the extracted `run_id` to build the correct URL for the Flow run logs page on `flow.shopifycloud.com`.
3.  **Opening in a New Tab:** It opens the constructed URL in a new tab, keeping your current Flow activity page open.

## Installation

1.  **Copy the Minified Code:** Copy the *entire* minified code block below. This is the complete, ready-to-use bookmarklet.

    javascript:(function(){const e=window.location.pathname.match(/\/apps\/flow\/activity\/([^\/\?]+)/);if(!e)return alert("Not a Flow activity page"),void 0;const t=e[1],o=new URLSearchParams;o.set("workflow_run_logs[run_id]",t),o.set("operation","View"),window.open(`https://flow.shopifycloud.com/internal/support/workflow_run_logs?${o.toString()}`,"_blank")})();

2.  **Create a New Bookmark:** In your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), create a new bookmark.

3.  **Paste the Code:** In the "URL" or "Location" field of the new bookmark, paste the minified code you copied in step 1.

4.  **Name the Bookmark:** Give your bookmark a descriptive name, such as "Flow Run Logs".

5.  **Save:** Save the bookmark.

## Building from Source (For Developers)

This `README.md` file is located in the `dist` directory, which is generated by the build process.  You generally don't need to rebuild the bookmarklet unless you're modifying the source code. If you *do* want to rebuild:

1.  **Navigate** to the package directory:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/damionrashford/bookmarklet-maker/bookmarklet-factory/packages/efficiency-bookmarklets/packages/flow-run-logs
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies** (only needed the first time):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Build Script:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

This will regenerate the `dist/index.min.js` (minified) and `dist/index.js` (unminified) files.  Use the *minified* version from `dist/index.min.js` for your bookmarklet.
